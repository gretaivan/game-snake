# SNAKE

Classic snake game, built to improve knowledge on DOM interactivity

## Design 
### Solving a problem 

+ I chose to visual design the elements in question: 
    + Game area that is represented by grid 10 x 10
    + Snake that is an object with properties head, tail and body length. Head and tail properties contains the integer that represent the square number in the grid.
